Internet works
*the data that are sending by cable
*stored companies like
*google
*facebook and other companies
*data is transmitted through via satellite
so the solution is to find the data on the internet circulates through the fiber optics cables
*data we want to store is stored in a data content on a SSD(solid state drive)server
IP address is given by ISD(internet service provider)DNS Server is specifically matches the websites
and host names
DNS server contains the database of public IP address
* Fiber optic cable -> (light pluse)Router -> (electrical signal )Internet cable or wifi.
* When we use mobile data ( foc->(electromagnetic waves )cell tower).
DATA SERVER:
*Is to identify the computers by IP address
*DNS converts names to numbers(IP address)
*Path to identify IP address
system->
1. Resolves name to Ip address.
2. If the IP address doesn't match it will send a query to the Resolver server.If it doesn't match again
send a query to the Root server.
root server->
1.Top or root of the DNS hierarchy.
2. 13 set of root servers around the world.Each one has an IP Address.
3. They are operated by 12 different organisations.
<->TLD<->Authoritative name server.
1.If root server doesn't find an IP address it will direct the resolver to the TLD(top level
domain).TLD server stores the address information for top level domains like .com, .net and
.org.
2.If TLD doesn't know IP address it will direct us to Authoritative name servers.It is
responsible for knowing Everything.
3.Once an IP address is found it will be stored in the cache memory.
*If the resolver receives the ip address it will store in cache memory.HTTP-Hypertext transfer protocol
*used for viewing webpages on the internet
*if we type web address it will automatically added at the beggining of the web address
* so all information is exchanged between computer and the web server
*any information that we type on website will transferd over the PUBLIC INTERNET
*and it is vulnerable to anybody who wants like hackers In order to
avoid this HTTPS is developed.
HTTPS(hypertext protocol secure)
1.It will make data impossible to read and it is done by using Encryption Algorithms.
-->SSL
1.Data is secured by using one of the protocols called Secure Socket Layer.It is used to
ensure security on the Internet.
2.The computer will ask for identity proof.The web server will send a certificate to prove
their ID.Once it is done it will send an acknowledgement to the web server.Finally the
encrypted data is exchanged between computer and web server.
-->TLS
TLS is designed to secure data against hackers and helps ensure that sensitive information
such as passwords and credit card numbers are safe.It is generally used to encrypt
communication among web packages and servers, including a web browser loading page. It
can be used for encrypting different voice messages for texts and IP.
Basics of web:
1. Web server - leading -> apache,IIS,lightpad,Jagspaw.
2. Web browser - leading-> Explorer,Firefox,Netscape and safari.
3.Routers and Switchers
HTML ,CSS ,JAVA script thus are used in web page.
* components in web page,
* user interface
* rendering engine ( html ,css) , used for visual reprentation
*HTML (mark up the content)
* CSS ( style and animate the content)
* Browser engine (interact between UI and rendering engine)
* To recive content browser wil communicate with network .
* 404 implies that unable to fetch the content.
* JAVA SCRIPT interpriter
* browser have its own JS interpriter
* Rendering engine reads the code and construst the DOM (document object model).
*DOM contains nodes , nodes can be image , text etc.
* After contructing the render tree the layout process starts.
* Render tree reverse the code by UI backend layers .
